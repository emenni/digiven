Proof of Concept

- This project is a react/typescript coding exercise. My objects goes towards
  learning new skills by creating POC for web technologies and JS frameworks and
  libs.

Thru this project, I achieve some nice skills:

- register a domain and make use of it on GCP
- deploy a project GCP App Engine (serverless)
- build a website and stack google technologies on it (GTM/Search Console/Google
  Analytics). I also achieved a google analytics certification
- cookies management over LGPD(Brazilian data privacy law)
- setting contentSecurityPolicy with helmet.js
- GCP CLI deploy
- Vite (dev server and build)
- React SSR (using hydration)
- React and non-React content mixing
- JSON-LD content consideration (SEO purpose)
- Web IDE usage (codesandbox.io)
- Usage of Chrome Lighthouse DevTool for measure and improve the website
- i18n: ptBr and enUS, but ready for ease including new languages on a json
  file.

Next Goals:

- A privacy policy page and a cookie consent 2nd screen for managing consent
  over specific types of cookies
- Provide GA4 such cookie settings, so it can consider visitor´s choice about
  it´s privacy.
- Make use of a SSR framework, Next or Remix
